---

## Introduction to Python

- Python is an easy-to-learn, powerful programming language.
- It was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991.
- Python is known for its simple syntax and readability.

---

## Why Python?

- Versatile and used in various fields like:
  - Web Development
  - Data Science
  - Machine Learning
  - Automation
- Beginner-friendly, even for non-programmers.

---

## Setting Up Python

1. Download and Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install a code editor:
   - **VS Code**, **PyCharm**, or **Sublime Text**
3. Open your terminal/command prompt and type `python --version` to check your Python version.

## Python Syntax Basics

```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")  # Prints text to the screen
```

## Variables and Data Types

    Variables store data values.
    Common data types in Python:
        int: Integer numbers
        float: Decimal numbers
        str: String (text)
        bool: Boolean (True/False)
```python
age = 25  # Integer
height = 5.9  # Float
name = "John"  # String
is_student = True  # Boolean
```
## Control Flow: if/else Statements
```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult!")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")

## Loops: for and while
For Loop

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # Prints numbers 0 to 4
```

While Loop

```python 
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
``` 

## Functions in Python

    Functions are reusable blocks of code.

def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")  # Calls the function
